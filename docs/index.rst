Welcome to Rood Kamer's documentation!
======================================

Welcome to what is currently referred to as *Operatie: Rood Kamer*, or *Operation: Red Room* for our non-Dutch speaking comrades. The idea is simple; we have a vision of a social media platform that is run by the people who use it. A community in its most primal meaning, not in the hollow interpretation found in the countless boardrooms of contemporary capitalism. Our hope for *Rood Kamer* is for it to be a communal organism working for something greater than can be achieved by our individual members upon their own. In an era ever more defined by the corporate organism with its top-down bureaucratic hierarchy; whose character is based solely on its insatiable appetite for wealth, we feel it is incumbent on the people of the world to develop an alternative.

Despite this admittedly grandiose vision, we endeavour to have no illusions as to what *Rood Kamer* might be able to accomplish. This project is not a "Facebook killer". Nor do we expect *Rood Kamer* to radically change the world. Our goal for this project is for it to illuminate implementable techniques to create a better way of cooperating with one and other, and to develop alternatives to the current capitalist nation state/corporate model. We expect to learn this through success, but probably more from failure (if we are to be entirely honest).

Also, we are bored and lonely. We are the geeks and iconoclasts who can't be content with the status quo. We want to make something more beautiful. Not for our own profit, but because it is what gives meaning to our existence. Because it is just fucking human.
